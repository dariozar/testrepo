  abstract = {In this paper we propose an overview of the recent academic literature devoted to the applications of Hawkes processes in finance. Hawkes processes constitute a particular class of multivariate point processes that has become very popular in empirical high frequency finance this last decade. After a reminder of the main definitions and properties that characterize Hawkes processes, we review their main empirical applications to address many different problems in high frequency finance. Because of their great flexibility and versatility, we show that they have been successfully involved in issues as diverse as estimating the volatility at the level of transaction data, estimating the market stability, accounting for systemic risk contagion, devising optimal execution strategies or capturing the dynamics of the full order book.},

  abstract = {Model selection is a general paradigm which includes many statistical problems. One of the most fruitful and popular approaches to carry it out is the minimization of a penalized criterion. Birgé and Massart (Probab. Theory Relat. Fields 138:33–73, 2006) have proposed a promising data-driven method to calibrate such criteria whose penalties are known up to a multiplicative factor: the “slope heuristics”. Theoretical works validate this heuristic method in some situations and several papers report a promising practical behavior in various frameworks. The purpose of this work is twofold. First, an introduction to the slope heuristics and an overview of the theoretical and practical results about it are presented. Second, we focus on the practical difficulties occurring for applying the slope heuristics. A~new practical approach is carried out and compared to the standard dimension jump method. All the practical solutions discussed in this paper in different frameworks are implemented and brought together in a Matlab graphical user interface called capushe. Supplemental Materials containing further information and an additional application, the capushe package and the datasets presented in this paper, are available on the journal Web site.},

  abstract = {Self-exciting point processes have been applied to a wide variety of applications to understand event rates and clustering as a function of time and space. Typically, estimation procedures require a full temporal history of the data and do not handle cases where some of the history of the process is missing and unobserved. However, in many applications data collection is non-persistent resulting in known intervals of time where events of the process are unobserved. Motivated by these situations, a Bayesian estimation procedure for self-exciting point processes with missing histories is developed. The method naturally handles the missing data mechanism probabilistically through a specific step and is demonstrated on simulated data and a real conflict monitoring data where records over a period of time have been lost.},

  abstract = {In the multiple changepoint setting, various search methods have been proposed which involve optimising either a constrained or penalised cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints using dynamic programming. Such methods are typically computationally intensive. Recent work in the penalised optimisation setting has focussed on developing a pruning-based approach which gives an improved computational cost that, under certain conditions, is linear in the number of data points. Such an approach naturally requires the specification of a penalty to avoid under/over-fitting. Work has been undertaken to identify the appropriate penalty choice for data generating processes with known distributional form, but in many applications the model assumed for the data is not correct and these penalty choices are not always appropriate. Consequently it is desirable to have an approach that enables us to compare segmentations for different choices of penalty. To this end we present a method to obtain optimal changepoint segmentations of data sequences for all penalty values across a continuous range. This permits an evaluation of the various segmentations to identify a suitably parsimonious penalty choice. The computational complexity of this approach can be linear in the number of data points and linear in the difference between the number of changepoints in the optimal segmentations for the smallest and largest penalty values. This can be orders of magnitude faster than alternative approaches that find optimal segmentations for a range of the number of changepoints.},

  abstract = {In this article, we consider the problem of detecting multiple changepoints in large datasets. Our focus is on applications where the number of changepoints will increase as we collect more data: for example, in genetics as we analyze larger regions of the genome, or in finance as we observe time series over longer periods. We consider the common approach of detecting changepoints through minimizing a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints. This includes several established procedures for detecting changing points, such as penalized likelihood and minimum description length. We introduce a new method for finding the minimum of such cost functions and hence the optimal number and location of changepoints that has a computational cost, which, under mild conditions, is linear in the number of observations. This compares favorably with existing methods for the same problem whose computational cost can be quadratic or even cubic. In simulation studies, we show that our new method can be orders of magnitude faster than these alternative exact methods. We also compare with the binary segmentation algorithm for identifying changepoints, showing that the exactness of our approach can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy of the inferred segmentation of the data.

  abstract = {Highly clustered event sequences are observed in certain types of crime data, such as burglary and gang violence, due to crime-specific patterns of criminal behavior. Similar clustering patterns are observed by seismologists, as earthquakes are well known to increase the risk of subsequent earthquakes, or aftershocks, near the location of an initial event. Space–time clustering is modeled in seismology by self-exciting point processes and the focus of this article is to show that these methods are well suited for criminological applications. We first review self-exciting point processes in the context of seismology. Next, using residential burglary data provided by the Los Angeles Police Department, we illustrate the implementation of self-exciting point process models in the context of urban crime. For this purpose we use a fully nonparametric estimation methodology to gain insight into the form of the space–time triggering function and temporal trends in the background rate of burglary.},

  abstract = {It is often assumed that events cannot occur simultaneously when modelling data with point processes. This raises a problem as real-world data often contains synchronous observations due to aggregation or rounding, resulting from limitations on recording capabilities and the expense of storing high volumes of precise data. In order to gain a better understanding of the relationships between processes, we consider modelling the aggregated event data using multivariate Hawkes processes, which offer a description of mutually-exciting behaviour and have found wide applications in areas including seismology and finance. Here we generalise existing methodology on parameter estimation of univariate aggregated Hawkes processes to the multivariate case using a Monte Carlo expectation–maximization (MC-EM) algorithm and through a simulation study illustrate that alternative approaches to this problem can be severely biased, with the multivariate MC-EM method outperforming them in terms of MSE in all considered cases.},
