This report summarizes the activities and projects I undertook during
the second year of my PhD in Physical Sciences at the University of
Palermo. My work, continuing from the first year, focused on two main fronts:
the application of complex systems methods on a dataset of homicides in Sicily,
and the development of tools for processing text documents at scale, and



spanned both academic research and educational initiatives.

The main research project involved a collaboration with the
Prosecutor's Office of Palermo, where we studied historical data on
homicides in Sicily. Additionally, we developed tools to extract
information from legal documents at scale, including the
implementation of a full-text search engine.

In a similar effort to gain insights through the lens of complex
systems, we built a network of people and companies connected to
mafia-related individuals.

I also participated in educational projects with high schools, such
as the PNLS (Piano Nazionale Lauree Scientifiche) in statistical
physics, organized by Prof. Miccich√®, and the Coding Girls project,
which promotes gender equality in STEM fields.

The following sections detail these projects, concluding with a list
of the courses, schools, and other activities I attended or contributed to.
