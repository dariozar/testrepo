# LaTeX template using MISE

This repository provides a minimal LaTeX template configured to work with [MISE](https://mise.jdx.dev/) and Visual Studio Code.

Whatâ€™s included
- A .vscode folder with some sensible default for working with LaTeX (thanks to [this amazing guide](https://paulwintz.com/latex-in-vscode/))
- A simple mise.toml with [tinytex](https://github.com/rstudio/tinytex) and the formatter [tex-fmt](https://github.com/WGUNDERWOOD/tex-fmt)
- Basic tasks implemented in mise: setup, install packages, build, clean

## Quick start

### MISE installation

Install MISE by following the guide [here](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html). The simplest way is

```bash
curl https://mise.run | sh
```

### Setup latex environment

First trust the mise.toml by running

```bash
mise trust
```

Then proceed to install any packages needed via `tlmgr install [package]` or by adding the package to the `tex-packages.txt` file.

After `tlmgr install [package]` it's possible to save the requirements file via `mise run save-tex-packages`. It's also possible to install from a requirements file via `mise run install-tex-packages`.

### Build

To build the project just run
```bash
mise run build
```

To clean run
```bash
mise run clean
```

### VSCode setup

Most of the VSCode settings require the installation of the recommended extensions in `.vscode/extensions.json`.
