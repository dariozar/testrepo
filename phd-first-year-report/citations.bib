	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Spontaneous activity of cortex {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in vitro{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in vivo{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} has been shown to organize as neuronal avalanches. Avalanches are cascades of neuronal activity that exhibit a power law in their size and duration distribution, typical features of balanced systems in a critical state. Recently it has been shown that the distribution of quiet times between consecutive avalanches in rat cortex slice cultures displays a non-monotonic behavior with a power law decay at short time scales. This behavior has been attributed to the slow alternation between up and down-states. Here we further characterize the avalanche process and investigate how the functional behavior of the quiet time distribution depends on the fine structure of avalanche sequences. By systematically removing smaller avalanches from the experimental time series we show that size and quiet times are correlated and highlight that avalanche occurrence exhibits the characteristic periodicity of θ and β/γ oscillations, which jointly emerge in most of the analyzed samples. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that smaller avalanches tend to be associated with faster β/γ oscillations, whereas larger ones are associated with slower θ and 1–2 Hz oscillations. In particular, large avalanches corresponding to θ cycles trigger cascades of smaller ones, which occur at β/γ frequency. This temporal structure follows closely the one of nested θ − β/γ oscillations. Finally we demonstrate that, because of the multiple time scales characterizing avalanche dynamics, the distributions of quiet times between avalanches larger than a certain size do not collapse onto a unique function when rescaled by the average occurrence rate. However, when considered separately in the up-state and in the down-state, these distributions are solely controlled by the respective average rate and two different unique function can be identified.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The aim of the present work is to investigate the relationships established within Cosa Nostra, by making use of networks and complex-systems methods. The analysis is performed at three different levels, that is, individuals, groups within mafia syndicates, and relationships amongst mafia syndicates. The reported empirical analysis is based on the criminal records of 632 affiliates to Cosa Nostra selected from a set of 125 judgements emitted by the Palermo courts from 2000 to 2014. According to the criminal records of the Palermo Prosecutor Office, such a dataset includes approximately 10\% of the whole population of Cosa Nostra affiliates in western Sicily. Furthermore, the vital statistics of 235 subjects sentenced for mafia crimes and the one of their relatives complemented the database that, overall, includes about 4000 subjects. Our results show that mafia syndicates are not specialized in terms of criminal activity, rather they show a strong territorial attachment and are involved in heterogeneous criminal activities. Since syndicates insist on a delimited territory, young affiliates are selected on a territorial basis according to the significance and variety of their past criminal activity. Once inside a syndicate, affiliates tend to specialize in a few criminal activities, depending on their attitudes and the needs of the organization. Finally, despite the fact that the vast majority of mafia affiliates are males, our results highlight that female subjects are crucial to form and consolidate alliances between mafia syndicates through suitable marriages.},

	abstract = {This book aims at providing a thorough and updated introduction to the key Information Retrieval (IR) concepts and technologies behind search engines. In the modern online world, seeking and finding information of value is of paramount importance and, for this, people often refer to search engines because of their inherent effectiveness and simplicity. Search engines work because they are anchored on the field of IR - the primary goal of an IR system is to retrieve all the documents that are relevant to a user information query, while retrieving as few non-relevant documents as possible. This ambitious view of the problem naturally leads to a wealth of concepts and technologies, which are required to implement the search box paradigm.    From parsing to indexing, clustering to classification, retrieval to ranking, and user feedback to retrieval evaluation, all of the most important concepts are carefully introduced and exemplified. The contents and structure of the book have been carefully designed by the two main authors, and the contributions of Eric Brown, Carlos Castillo, Marcos Goncalves, David Hawking, Marti Hearst, Mounia Lalmas, Yoelle Maarek, Christian Middleton, Gonzalo Navarro, Dulce Ponceleon, Edie Rasmussen, Malcolm Slaney, and Nivio Ziviani greatly enrich the text with individual expertise from leaders in the field.    This completely reorganized, revised and enlarged second edition of Modern Information Retrieval contains four new chapters and double the number of pages and bibliographic references of the first edition, and a companion website with teaching material. It will prove invaluable to students, professors, researchers, practitioners, and scholars of this fascinating field of IR},
